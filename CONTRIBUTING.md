# Contributing

* Fork and clone the repo
* Modify `everything-is-okay.json` OR `README.md`
* `npm run readme` OR `npm run json`
* Commit and push your changes!
* Make the Pull Request

Note: When using `npm run json` the script assumes consistent Markdown syntax, so check `everything-is-okay.json` to see if things built correctly. At worst, one of the contributors will take care of it, so don't worry.
